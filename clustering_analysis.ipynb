    "# GitHub Clustering Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we explore the application of clustering algorithms to GitHub repositories. The goal is to uncover patterns, similarities, and groupings within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Programming Language Clustering:**\n",
    "   - Cluster repositories based on the programming languages used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Popularity and Activity Clustering:**\n",
    "   - Cluster repositories based on metrics like stars, forks, and issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Community Engagement Clustering:**\n",
    "   - Use metrics related to community engagement, such as contributors, pull requests, and issue comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mixed Metrics Clustering:**\n",
    "   - Combine multiple metrics, such as stars, forks, and programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temporal Clustering:**\n",
    "   - Cluster repositories based on temporal patterns, such as contributions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Means Clustering\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming 'X' is a matrix with selected metrics for each repository\n",
    "kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)\n",
    "kmeans.fit(X)\n",
    "labels = kmeans.labels_\n"
